# Java Code Analysis Web App

# Introduction

<p>The Code Analyzer Web App is a powerful tool designed to analyze Java code files, calculate code complexity, identify syntax errors, and help you maintain clean and efficient code. It provides a range of features to enhance the coding experience, from complexity analysis to code duplication detection.</p>

# Features

<ul>
<li>User Management: register, login, profile</li>
<li>Code Complexity Analysis: Analyze the complexity of your Java code, helping you maintain clean and efficient software.</li>
<li>Software Composition Analysis Metrics: Calculate metrics related to your code's structure, including class counts, and more.</li>
<li>Syntax Error Detection: Identify and highlight syntax errors within the uploaded Java code, making it easier to catch and correct mistakes.</li>
<li>Code Duplication Detection: Find and display duplicated code sections, offering recommendations to refactor and reduce redundancy.</li>
<li>Code Revision: Save and access previously uploaded code files in your user profile for future reference and analysis.</li>
<li>User Reviews: Allow users to provide feedback and reviews about the tool, helping to improve and enhance its features.</li>
